### Quotes
> “It was all right,” said Billy. “Everything is all right, and everybody has to do exactly what he does. I learned that on Tralfamadore." (254)

The Tralfamadorians believe that each moment in time is structured, so that all things are meant to be. This belief becomes the best way for Billy to deal with the trauma of war, for it is necessary for him to believe that everything happened for a reason, because the moment was structured so. He needs that explanation for the war, because otherwise he would have to confront the senseless irrationality and the absolute lack of reason for everything that has happened to him.

> “But among them was this poor Earthling, and his head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off. There was only one eyehole through which he could look, and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe… Whatever poor Billy saw through the pipe, he had no choice but to say to himself, ‘That’s life.’” (147)

> "It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds. And what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like “Poo-tee-weet?” (24)"

### Thoughts
*Slaughterhouse Five* portrays war, a concept of brutality and destruction, as something that is merely absurd at its core. The story’s comical absurdity not only depicts the impact of frontline life on the narrator, but it also exemplifies the irrationality of war which cannot be understood with any common reason.

Billy is described as a time traveler who not only interacts with aliens but also travels through different moments of his life randomly. It fuses “remembering” with “experiencing,” as he simultaneously remembers his life at different moments but also personally experiences it through time travel. Reasonably, we know that Billy cannot time travel, but choosing to depict Billy in this way, Vonnegut is commenting on the long-lasting impact of war on those who live through it, and how wartime experiences are constantly replayed even after the war. The impact of war supersedes the passing of time, and Billy is caught in the war and cannot be freed from it even with the flowing of time.

The absurdity of war is parallel to the absurdity of Billy’s beliefs after the war. War itself is portrayed in a comical fashion, with Billy, skinny and frail, in a tiny coat and even a toga, as well as silver shoes that he has taken from the Cinderella show. It is difficult to imagine war in this way, which parallels Barbara’s confusion at her father’s erratic behavior after the war. Billy never quite understands what has happened during the war, just as Barbara cannot understand what is going on in Billy’s head. This inability to make sense of things is one common characteristic in the relationships between Billy and the war and between Barbara and Billy, and it certainly is a commonly seen feature of the second world war and the postwar years.
