### About the book

* **Author:** Emily Bronte
* **Year of publication:** 1847

### Themes
* **Revenge** - Heathcliff’s revenge is the most prominent theme that strings together the storyline and the characters. His devilish brutality and evil designs invoke terror and fear in the audience. However, the ending of the novel seems to signify another perspective on his revenge. Indeed, as he loses himself in his wild passion and dangerous vengeance, Catherine Linton and Hareton Earnshaw regain authority over their families’ properties, and despite the havoc Heathcliff has caused in the two households, they eventually find peace and love again. In the end, Heathcliff’s revenge fails to leave a long-lasting impact, but it has certainly led to his own demise.

* **Love (or the destructive power thereof)** - Love may seem to be a hackneyed theme, but it definitely plays a key role in the novel. While Heathcliff displays an intense, extreme, and painful form of this emotion, there are also other expressions of love—Edgar Linton’s devotion to Catherine, Cathy’s concern for her father, and even Hareton Earnshaw’s somewhat blinded and unrequited attachment to Heathcliff. It seems that each character has their own way of expressing their love, and it is the combination of these various forms of love that makes the story so grand and breathtaking.

* **The precariousness of social class**


### Character Analysis
* **Catherine Earnshaw** - I have mixed feelings about Catherine Earnshaw. On one hand, I find her arrogant, spoiled, and ignorant. She has no concern for others’ feelings and demands that everything be in accordance with her own will. On the matter of love, she is cherished by both Edgar Linton and Heathcliff, yet she only loves herself the most and has thus hurt them both. I dislike her for her role in bringing about so many people’s destruction, yet on the other hand, I find her to be lost, confused, and fragile. She loves Edgar, yet she loves Heathcliff even more so, and she is torn between her loyalty and her wild passion. Heathcliff’s existence pains her, but she cannot ask him to leave either. Although she has brought pain upon so many others, she is just as tormented herself. Perhaps death offers the only escape for her, which Nelly describes as divine with her countenance resembling “perfect peace.”
* **Edgar Linton & Heathcliff** - I think these two characters, both competing for the same woman’s heart, serve as exact opposites of each other. Edgar is soft, passionate, understanding, and treasures Catherine unconditionally. These attributes of his contrast sharply with Heathcliff, who is dark, possessive, vindictive, and selfish. While Edgar does his best to fulfill Catherine’s wishes, Heathcliff follows his own dark passion even at the cost of bringing pain upon Catherine. He never forgives Catherine for marrying Edgar, and perhaps he would never understand why she has agreed to marry Edgar at all. Blinded by his horrendous passion, he has devastated himself, Edgar, as well as Catherine.

### Quotes
* *“It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff, now; so he shall never know how I love him; and that, not because he’s handsome, Nelly, but because **he's more myself than I am**. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same, and Linton’s is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire.”* (Chapter 9, pages 85-86, Catherine confesses her feelings for Heathcliff)

* *“**If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the Universe would turn to a mighty stranger…** My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods. Time will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees – my love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath – a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, **I am Heathcliff** – he’s always, always in my mind – not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself – but, as my own being…”* (Chapter 9, page 87, Catherine confesses her feelings for Heathcliff)

* *“You teach me now how cruel you've been - cruel and false. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight you - they'll damn you. You loved me - what right had you to leave me? What right - answer me - for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will did it. **I have not broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.** So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you - Oh, God! would you like to lie with your soul in the grave?”* (Heathcliff accuses Catherine of separating them)

### Thoughts
I knew that I enjoyed gothic literature after reading Frankenstein, but Wuthering Heights reconfirmed that even more. This book has made me shudder more than Frankenstein, perhaps because this story takes place in a more realistic setting (creating devilish creatures from a laboratory is after all not quite relatable in real life). I sympathized with Heathcliff for a little while as Nelly describes the injustices that he has suffered at the hands of both the Lintons and the Earnshaws, but all my sympathies vanished as his words and deeds become increasingly appalling with no remorse. When Cathy begins developing feelings for Linton much against everyone else’s advice, I feared for her to the point of being annoyed by her ignorance and imprudence. At the same time, I was extremely disgusted by Heathcliff who is willing to take advantage of everyone, including his son, in order to achieve his means. I feel like he loves nobody but himself, and everyone else is merely the means for him to achieve his selfish goals.
