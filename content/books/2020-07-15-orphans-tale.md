### Thoughts
This is a powerful and breathtaking work. Switching between Noa’s and Astrid’s perspective, it reveals the complexity of their relationship with each other, from intense hostility to a sort of mutual understanding and empathy, founded upon the hardships that both have to endure as well as the strength and courage that both have displayed. Other characters are powerful and unique figures as well. Erich, for example: his indifference as he casts Astrid out is a perfect revelation of the brainwashing power of the Reich, yet his help transferring the letter from Astrid’s brother and the money he provides her to reach safety seem to indicate something beneath his nonchalance, something more complex and more profound that his loyalty to the Reich. Peter, too, is a unique character, a powerful representation of those who staunchly believe in the evils of the Reich to the point of bringing destruction upon themselves. Perhaps I knew from his constant rehearsals of his “incorrect” acts and his steadfast refusal to perform the Vichy anthem that someday trouble would befall him, but the incident comes when I least expect it. His surprise wedding with Astrid has been such a beautiful scene, a representation of the power of love even in times like that, but the disaster that follows immediately tears apart the lovely image that the author has just depicted. From then on, the story has taken a turn, from something suspenseful yet relatively peaceful to something that’s emotionally overwhelming, as if the constraints that the author has placed onto the characters’ feelings have suddenly been let loose. I had to skip paragraphs because they were simply too hard to read. Noa’s death was very unexpected as well. I had noted the theme of self-sacrifice when Astrid decides to give Noa the ticket to safety, but I never expected that in the end, Noa would be the one who gives up her future for Astrid. The last chapter, with Astrid at the museum in America, wraps up the narrative in a deeply emotional way. Noa and Luc have died the same night, yet they would never know that. Luc never abandons Noa after all, and they are together in death.
