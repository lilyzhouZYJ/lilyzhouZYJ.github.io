### Thoughts
*Fahrenheit 451* presents a powerful story that interweaves the themes of alienation, conformity, and the power of knowing. As a dystopian science fiction, it paints a gloomy picture of a future founded upon mechanization, media, and the conforming masses. The main character Guy Montag, after watching a woman commit suicide for the sake of books, begins to awaken from his daily habituation. He begins to question the meaning of his occupation, which drives him to seek after not only books but also an understanding of the world around him. His quest would bring danger to himself, but it also brings him closer to liberation of the mind.

Mildred, Montag’s wife, exemplifies the numbing stimulation of mass media. Her life is mechanical and superficial, with no concern for anything outside of her “family”—the TV set that takes up three walls in the parlor. The irony of naming the TV set “family” is clear: instead of engaging with her real-life family Montag, Mildred obsesses over the entertainment that technology and mass communication have brought her. In the world that Bradbury is portraying, the superficial stimulation of mass media has left no space for meaningful interpersonal relationships, and instead, all values become rooted in the mechanization of life.

While the novel delivers a cautionary tale regarding the dangers of mass media, it also reveals the meaning of knowledge. The novel uses books as the symbolic carrier for knowledge, but as Faber points out, books represent only one form of receptacle for “things we [are] afraid we might forget” (79). The key of knowledge is precisely to store such things that must be remembered for their quality and significance. And the key of life is to recognize and embrace those things that are worth remembering.

The more political message of the novel lies in the authorities’ suppression of individuality and its encouragement of ignorance. It reveals the consequences of obeying without thinking for oneself. In the beginning, Montag performs the duty of a fireman like a machine programmed to obey nothing but the alarms. Mildred and her friends are convinced of the evil of books without ever reading one. Mildred even reports her own husband because of her blind faith in the authorities, whatever the authorities may consist of. On the other hand, Clarisse, whose family follows their own traditions in seeking after a truly meaningful life, disappears into an unknown but inauspicious destiny. And Montag becomes an enemy of the state for his attempt at understanding his surroundings. Conformity is the pillars upon which the system is constructed, so individuality necessarily becomes the fundamental threat to its stability. 

Although the book was published in the 1950s, its message has survived the change of time and still stands today. In the past decades, technology has nothing but developed rapidly, and the fears that Bradbury had in mind when he wrote the book have only come closer to realization. Mass media has permeated all aspects of everyday life, and it controls the mind of the people like no other means. It is important to recognize Bradbury’s warning in Fahrenheit 451—that we must not fall prey to the superficial stimulation of mass media, and that the moral imperative for us is to think for ourselves.
