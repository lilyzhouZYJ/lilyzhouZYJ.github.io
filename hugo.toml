I'm a **software engineer** at **Azure Storage** at Microsoft, working on its **core distributed metadata component** that manages all data-stream metadata in Storage.

I graduated *magna cum laude* from **Yale University**, where I double-majored in **Computer Science** and **History** and earned a *Distinction in the Major* of Computer Science.

I'm interested in:
- distributed systems
- backend infrastructure  
- complex problems
- root-causing concurrency bugs (but yes they drive me crazy too)
- 20th-century East European history
- or anything that makes me think and think again

When I'm not working, you'll find me:
- climbing
- hiking
- running
- practicing for an upcoming kpop dance cover
- making pottery
- or on days of poor logistical planning, all of the above
